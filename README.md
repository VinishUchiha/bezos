There are many great reinforcement learning frameworks on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that was light and small enough to let me fork it and add my own algorithms while still feeling in control. I thus created Bezos, a very light RL framework which implements all the boring things so that you don't have to. 

## Features
- Rollout class (supports GAE, reward to go, and recurrent neural network)
- Runner class: loads a Gym env and runs one or multiple agents on the environment to generate rollouts
- A simple Actor Critic Network
- RL Algorithm: PPO [Paper on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)
- RL Algorithm: A2C [OpenAI blog post](https://openai.com/blog/baselines-acktr-a2c/)
- Supports all the OpenAI Gym env
- I added all the Vizdoom envs as well (look into kits/)
- Supports the marLo env [Github](https://github.com/crowdAI/marLo) (look into kits/)
- A bunch of useful OpenAI Gym wrappers. Includes frame skipping, RGB→Grayscale, cropping, and many more. (look into envs.py)

### Built With
The framework uses Pytorch to do all the deep learning stuff, numpy, and OpenAI Gym
* [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
* [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
* [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Bezos has been designed to be configured before each run with a YAML file. Some examples of those YAML config files can be found in the configs folder. If you want to know what a parameter does (they are all self explanatory) check the source :)

### Installation

- Create a new conda env (yo don't use python 2 ok)
- ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
### Train a model (params in the config file) 
```bash
python bezos.py --config ./configs/ppo-minecraft.yaml train
```
### Evaluate a model
```bash
python bezos.py --config ./configs/ppo-minecraft.yaml evaluate --det
```
